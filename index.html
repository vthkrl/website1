                    <p>Hey, I'm Vikrant. <br><br>I'm 16.<br><br>I enjoy learning about all kinds of stuff, including, but not limited to; computers, politics (including political theory), video games, programming, music, movies and even philosophy.<br><br>I've always felt like computers have been my thing, but in the recent years I've become much more politically aware and try to keep up with other subjects such as the ones I mentioned earlier. <br><br>My hobbies and interests include playing video games, video editing using Adobe Premiere Pro, Sony VEGAS and Adobe After Effects, photo editing using Photoshop, Lightroom and GIMP, reading books on various subjects, playing chess, programming in Python and Java, and engaging in debates. </p>
